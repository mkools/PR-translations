//	This file contains all the data related to points, bounty and experience
//	earning. The structure is pretty simple, look for the action you wish to
//	edit, and change its value. Note, if you put a negative value, the points
//	bounty or experience will be substracted. All events have a description
//	on them so it will be easy to understand.
//
//	The structure:
//
//	//The explanation of the event goes here
//	"event_name" //This is the event tag name, used by the plugin for reference, do not change
//	{
//		"points"	"1" //Points added when this event is fired (The action owner receives them)
//		"bounty"	"30" //Bounty received by this action
//		"exp"		"10" //Exp received by this action
//		"name"		"Event Name done: " //What is print in chat, leave blank to avoid displaying. -> [RPG] Event Name Done: 30 bounty received
//	}
